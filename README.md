## 📋 About laravel-oidc-server

laravel-oidc-server is a tool that helps websites use OpenID Connect for login and security. It works with Laravel Passport, a popular way to manage user identity tokens in Laravel apps. 

This server makes it simple to add features like:
- Finding information about the server and its keys (Discovery, JWKS)
- Getting details about users (UserInfo)
- Checking if tokens are still valid (Token Introspection)
- Canceling tokens when needed (Token Revocation)
- Signing out users from apps (RP-Initiated Logout)

You don't need to be a programmer to use this guide. We explain all you need to download and run the software.

## 🖥 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your computer or server meets these needs:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.13 or later, or Linux with PHP support
- **PHP Version:** PHP 7.4 or higher installed
- **Laravel Version:** Laravel 7.x or newer installed (requires Laravel setup)
- **Web Server:** Apache or Nginx configured to run Laravel apps
- **Composer:** Installed to manage PHP packages
- **Internet Connection:** Required to download files and check dependencies

If you plan to run laravel-oidc-server in a live environment, you will also need a database supported by Laravel (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) and a valid SSL certificate for secure connections.

If you are not familiar with Laravel or Laravel Passport, you may want to read basic Laravel tutorials first. This guide will focus on how to get laravel-oidc-server ready to use after downloading.

## ⚙ How to Use laravel-oidc-server

Once installed, laravel-oidc-server adds routes to your Laravel app for the OpenID Connect protocol:

- **Discovery Endpoint:** Your app will provide URLs describing how to authenticate.
- **JWKS Endpoint:** Provides JSON Web Key Sets used for signing tokens.
- **UserInfo Endpoint:** Returns user details after login.
- **Token Introspection & Revocation:** Lets clients check token validity or revoke tokens.
- **RP-Initiated Logout:** Allows user logout from relying parties.

Use these URLs in your OAuth/OpenID clients. The package takes care of token handling and communication.

---

## 🔧 Configuration Tips

- Edit the config file `config/oidc-server.php` to set things like token lifetimes, scopes, and endpoints.
- Use your database to store OAuth clients and tokens.
- Enable HTTPS to secure token exchange.
- Review your Laravel Passport client setup for OAuth clients you want to use with this server.
- Look into Laravel middleware if you want to protect or restrict access to some endpoints.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Package not found after install?** Run `composer update` and check your `composer.json`.
- **Endpoints not working?** Verify Laravel routes with `php artisan route:list`.
- **Tokens not validated?** Check your key settings and JWKS configuration.
- **Database errors?** Confirm migrations ran and connection info is correct.
- **Authentication fails?** Ensure Laravel Passport clients have proper scopes and secrets.
